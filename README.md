## Internal Styles
---
This project is about converting code using inline styles to utilizing internal styles. This is a process known as **refactoring**. You should think of your projects as a starting point that will need to be refined. When we refactor, we are taking something that is functional and making it better, _more streamlined and/or efficient_. This process is not an easy task, but you will get better with time.

###Part 1: Looking at the code..
You will notice that there is some basic code that utilizes inline styles to create a glorious color scheme. **sarcasm**. Look through _index.html_ as well as _about.html_. These are two pages that will be served up based on the current server configuration.
